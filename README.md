Authors: Nissim DJERROUDI & Vo Thi Quynh Yen (@ndjerrou & @themonster2015)

Description: This is a simple project that clones the interface of the Intuit signup page using HTML and CSS.<br>
Method used: We used flexbox together with other CSS properties to position and align the elements.<br>
Possible improvement: make it mobile-responsive.<br>
